It's hosted using AWS S3 and Cloudfront and deployed using Github Actions.

## Setup

1. Ruby 2.6
1. [bundler](https://bundler.io)

To get it running locally, run:

2. `bundle install`
3. `make serve`

If you give this a try and find steps are missing (or find any other issue), please open a new issue or PR. Thanks!
