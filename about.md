## Me

I am a software developer primarily focused on mobile and iOS. I live in Berkeley, CA and work at Autodesk on mobile construction software.

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/benasher44) or via email at hello @ this domain. You can find some of my work on [github](https://github.com/benasher44).

## This Site

This website is built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), styled with [bulma](https://bulma.io), and designed by me with inspiration from [jessesquires.com](https://jessesquires.com).

#### TODOs

At the moment, it's functional enough for me to write, but there are a few more things coming:

- Filtering for categories and tags
- Resume
- A bit more about myself
